### Part 1: Single User
+ Open the root route and follow the first link to manage a single user
+ Open pages_controller, note the gon assignment in the manage_user action. Verify that gon.user_id exists in the JS console.
+ Fetch the single user in the `user.js`'s init function

```
var self = this
$.ajax({
  url: "/api/users/1",
  method: "GET"
}).then(function (data) {
  self.user = data
})
```

+ display the user's name and email address in page
+ Add a button that says "edit" and a `v-on:click=editUser`
+ Wrap the user's name, email, and the button with a div that has the directive `v-if="!isEditing`
+ Add a method called `editUser` that changes `isEditing` to true
+ Add a form to be displayed when the edit button is pressed. It'll have 2 inputs, one with a v-model for user.email and the other user.name
+ Add an input with a type of submit and a value of submit to the form.
+ Add the directive `v-on:submit.prevent="handleEdit"` to your form and a method `handleEdit`.
+ `console.log` the user when the form is submitted
+ Save the user to the database when the form is submitted
```
        var self = this
        $.ajax({
          method: "PATCH",
          url: userUrl(gon.user_id),
          data: { user: self.user }
        }).then(function (data) {
          self.user = data
          self.isEditing = false
          })
```
+ set `self.isEditing` to false when the user is saved.

### Part 2: Many Users
+ Open app/assets/javascripts/components/users.js. Open a new browser tab to where the function usersUrl evaluates to.
+ In the JavaScript console of localhost:3000, run `$.ajax({ method: "GET", url: "/api/users" }).then(function (data) { console.log(data) })`
+ Holy crap, promises! 
+ Use that `$.ajax` call to fill our component with users.
+ Use Vue Dev Tools to verify that our users component is full of users.
+ render an unordered list of users
+ Add a searchText key to the Users data object
+ Add an input with a v-model set to searchText
+ Filter the list with searchText
+ Next to each user, add a button with the text "edit"
+ Create a new file called app/assets/components/user.js. Register a new Vue component called "vue-user"
+ Create a file called vue_templates/user.html and add a script tag with the type of text/template and an id of user-template. Place the text `i'm the user template` inside of the template.
+ Make sure your `vue-user` component has a `template: #user-template` and that you're rendering the partial `vue_templates/user` inside of the `home.html.erb` file.
+ Add the key ` props: ['user'],` to your vue-user component. 
+ Iterate over your users via `<vue-user v-for="user in users" :user="user"> <vue-user>`
+ Extract the guts of each `<li>` into your vue-user template file.
+ When a user clicks "edit" the user's static text fields should turn into inputs, and the "edit" button should turn into a save.
